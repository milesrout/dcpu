                A Floating Point Unit for the DCPU-16

This is a short document describing the DFPU-17 (D17), a
floating-point coprocessor for the DCPU-16 (D16). Despite its
simplicity, the DCPU-16 provides significant
functionality. However, a significant problem is its lack of
high-throughput floating-point support. The D17 exists to solve
this problem.

                DCPU-16 Hardware Info:

Name: DFPU-17 - Floating Point Coprocessor
ID: 0x1DE171F3, Version: 0x0001
Manufacturer: 0x52307537 (MILES_ROUT)

                Description:

The DFPU-17 (D17) is an optional floating-point coprocessor for
the DCPU-16. Its main purpose is to be used for navigation and
orientation in space. It is capable of operating in various modes
depending on whether the user's needs.

The D17 has three banks of memory: two 512-word DATA banks and a
256-word TEXT bank. Each time floating-point data needs to be
processed, the user loads text and data into the device and
instructs it to execute the text on the data. The two DATA banks
are double-buffered: the CPU can retrieve data while the device is
working on data. The device works on the "primary buffer" while
the "secondary buffer" is readable and writable by the CPU.
Swapping the buffers simply swaps these labels: the primary
buffer becomes the secondary buffer and vice versa.

Note: The TEXT bank is NOT double-buffered. If the CPU interrupts
the device with the LOAD_TEXT command while the device is
executing code, undefined behaviour will occur: most likely the
device will be rendered inoperable until a hard reset is
performed.

                Interrupt Behaviour:

When a hardware interrupt is received by the D17, it reads the Z
register and does one of the following actions:

 (0x00) SET_MODE: The device will read the A register and sets the
        operating mode to one of the following options:

        0x00: MODE_OFF. The device will be deactivated, clearing
        all of its data and code memory, and putting it into
        standby mode. The device will have negligible power drain
        while in standby, and will respond only to the SET_MODE
        command.

        0x01: MODE_INT: The device will be activated if in
        MODE_OFF. Whenever the device receives an EXECUTE command,
        it will swap buffers and then execute. When it has completed
        execution it will swap buffers again and interrupt the
        CPU.

        Note: In MODE_INT the device can only effectively use one
        buffer.

        Note: Switching to MODE_INT will fail and set an error
        status and error message if SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE has not
        been called.

        0x02: MODE_POLL: The device operates in the same way as
        MODE_INT, except the D17 will not automatically swap buffers,
        nor interrupt the CPU when finished. Instead, it is the CPU's
        responsibility to poll the device to determine its status.

        Note: In MODE_POLL the CPU has more responsibility and incurs
        more load, but as a result it can make use of both DATA banks.

    Note: See end of document for a demonstration of a procedure for
    using MODE_POLL.

 (0x01) SET_PREC: The device will read the A register and set the
        working precision level. The default is single-precision.

        0x00: PREC_SINGLE: The D17 will work with single-precision
        floating point numbers. Invalidates loaded text and data.

        0x01: PREC_DOUBLE: The D17 will work with double-precision
        floating point numbers. Invalidates loaded text and data.

        0x02: PREC_HALF: The D17 will work with half-precision
        floating point numbers. Invalidates loaded text and data.

 (0x02) GET_STATUS: The next interrupt to the device with the
        message 0xFFFF will set the following registers as
        described:

        A: STATUS: the status, selected from the statuses listed
        in Table I: Statuses.
 
        B: ERROR: the most recent error message, selected from the
        error messages listed in Table II: Error Messages.

        C: the register is set to 0.  X: the register is set to 0.

        Note: this is so that future expansion of GET_STATUS
        incorporating useful information in C and X will not break
        programs that assume that those registers will be ignored
        by GET_STATUS.

 (0x03) LOAD_DATA: The device will read the A register and load
        512 words from the CPU's RAM at address A into the secondary
        DATA buffer. The address must be aligned at a 512 word boundary.

 (0x04) LOAD_TEXT: The device will read the A register and load
        256 words from the CPU's RAM at address A into the
        TEXT buffer. The address must be aligned at a 512 word boundary.

 (0x05) GET_DATA: The device will read the A register and load 512
        words of data from the secondary buffer into the CPU's RAM at
        address A. The address must be aligned at a 512 word boundary.

 (0x06) EXECUTE: The device will not read any registers. If in
        MODE_POLL, the device will process the data in the primary
        buffer.
        
        If in MODE_INT, the device will swap buffers and then process
        the data in the new primary buffer. When finished, the device
        will swap buffers again and then interrupt the CPU with the
        interrupt message set with SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE.

 (0x07) SWAP_BUFFERS: Swap the primary and secondary DATA
        buffers. Only works in MODE_POLL.

 (0x08) SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE: The device will set the interrupt
        message used while in MODE_INT to the contents of the A
        register.

                Instruction Set Architecture:

The D17 has sixteen/eight/four (depending on precision) floating point
registers and four 8-bit integer flow control and indexing registers.
The device's memory is indexed according to the precision mode i.e.
in PREC_DOUBLE mode, the smallest addressable unit of memory is a
64-bit double, while in PREC_HALF mode, it is a 16-bit half.

The device also has a small stack for storing integers. It is a true stack:
only the topmost item may be accessed. It is also very small: a maximum size
of four items.

Note: Accessing the upper twelve registers while in double-precision
mode or the upper eight while in single-precision mode is
undefined behaviour.

The instruction mnemonics below use the following scheme:
     % means 'floating-point register'
     @ means 'integer register'
     $ means 'integer immediate'

All instructions fall into one of three categories:

 (a) Arithmetic instructions, which each take a single cycle.

     rnd    %    - round to integer   (back into %register)
     abs    %    - absolute value     (a = |a|)
     add   %,%   - addition           (a = a + b)
     mul   %,%   - multiply           (a = a * b)
     sub   %,%   - subtract           (a = a - b)
     rsub  %,%   - subtract (reverse) (a = b - a)
     div   %,%   - divide             (a = a / b)
     rdiv  %,%   - divide (reverse)   (a = b / a)
     fma  %,%,%  - fused multiply-add (a = a + b * c)
     atan %,%,%  - 2-arg arctangent   (a = arctan(y/x))

     rnd   @,%   - round to integer   (into @register) (REMOVED)

     lt   @,%,%  - if %left < %right, then @ = 0, else @ = 1
     gt   @,%,%  - if %left > %right, then @ = 0, else @ = 1
     eq   @,%,%  - if %left == %right, then @ = 0, else @ = 1
     ne   @,%,%  - if %left != %right, then @ = 0, else @ = 1

 (b) Floating-point functions such as trigonometric functions,
     which take a variable number of cycles.

     sin    %    - sine
     cos    %    - cosine
     tan    %    - tangent
     asin   %    - inverse sine
     acos   %    - inverse cosine
     atan   %    - inverse tangent
     sqrt   %    - square root
     log10  %    - logarithm base 10
     log2   %    - logarithm base 2
     log    %    - natural logarithm

 (c) Integral and flow-control instructions that operate on integer
     registers.
     
     noop        - no operation
     wait        - pause until EXECUTE is called again  (status=WAITING)
     halt        - stop execution and reset state       (status=DONE)
     fail        - stop execution and reset state       (status=FAILED)
     set   @,$   - load an immediate integer into register
     set   @,@   - move the value from @right to @left
     swap  @,@   - swap the values in two registers
     dec    @    - decrement register
     inc    @    - increment register
     zero   @    - set register to zero
     push   @    - push register to the integer stack
     pop    @    - move from the integer stack into register
     peek   @    - copy from the integer stack into register
     jmp    @    - jump to register
     jmp    $    - jump to immediate address
     jc    @,$   - jump to immediate address if register is zero
     jc    @,@   - jump to @right if @left is zero
     cmp   @,$   - if @a < $x, then @a := -1 (255)
                   else if @a > $x, then @a := 1
	           else @a := 0
     loop  @,$   - decrement register then jump to immediate address
                   if register is non-zero

     Note: The device operates most efficiently when flow-control
     is minimised.

 (d) Memory-related instructions such as loads and stores.
     
     ld    %,$   - load a floating point number from DATA
     ld    %,@   - load a floating point number from DATA
     ldz    %    - load zero              (0.0)
     ld1    %    - load one               (1.0)
     ldl2e  %    - load the logarithm base 2 of e
     ldl2x  %    - load the logarithm base 2 of 10
     ldlg2  %    - load the logarithm base 10 of 2
     ldln2  %    - load the natural logarithm of 2
     ldpi   %    - load pi                (~3.1415)
     lde    %    - load euler's number    (~2.7183)
     ldsr2  %    - load square root of 2  (~1.4142)
     ldphi  %    - load golden ratio      (~1.6180)
     st    $,%   - store a floating point number in DATA
     st    @,%   - store a floating point number in DATA
     mov   %,%   - copy from %right to %left
     xchg  %,%   - exchange %left and %right

     Note: The device does not support the loading of arbitrary
     literal floating-point immediates, so anything that would
     otherwise be an immediate must be loaded as data. The device
     does have some instructions to load arbitrary integral
     immediates.

                Instruction Format:

The precise encoding of each function is given in Appendix 1.

                Short form instructions

These are highly dense short forms of other more general
instructions. Any word where the most significant bits of
the MSB and the LSB are both set encodes two short form
instructions viz.

     0*** **** 0*** **** - does not encode two short instructions
     0*** **** 1*** **** - does not encode two short instructions
     1*** **** 0*** **** - does not encode two short instructions
     1aaa aaaa 1bbb bbbb - two short form instructions, a and b.

The MSB is executed first. TODO: explain why

     zero   @a    - 00000aa
     inc    @a    - 00001aa
     dec    @a    - 00010aa
     jmp    @a    - 00011aa
     jc    @a,@b  - 001aabb
     set   @a,@b  - 010aabb
     swap  @a,@b  - 011aabb
     
     mov   %r,%s  - 100rrss (*)
     add   %r,%s  - 101rrss (*)
     sub   %r,%s  - 110rrss (*)
     mul   %r,%s  - 111rrss (*)

Note: the short-form instructions marked with a (*) are only
abled to encode a subset of the operands the instruction can
take. 

e.g. add %2,%1 can be short-form-encoded but add %15,%3 cannot.

                Immediates

Immediate values are values included in the instruction stream
itself.

Floating-point numbers cannot be encoded as immediates, so any floats
a program needs should be included in DATA. Many commonly used
constants have special loading instructions.

     e.g. 'ldpi %0' will set %0 to π.

Integers can be encoded as immediates. Integer registers can be
set to arbitrary integral immediates, but also many integral and
flow control instructions can take immediate arguments without
having to go through the very limited integral register set.

                Loops and Flow Control:
        
The loop instruction implements an efficient downwards-counting
loop. It takes an index register and a relative offset, which it
uses to jump back.

For example, the Babylonian method for computing square roots can be
computed like this:

        ld       %0,$0        ; load first memory cell (number to sqrt) into %0
        ld1      %1           ; load 1 into %1
        ld       %3,$1        ; load second memory cell (literal 2.0) into %3
        set      @0,$a        ; load 10 into @0
    LABEL:
        mov      %2,%0        ;      %2 <- S
        div      %2,%1        ;      %2 <- S / x_n
        add      %2,%1        ;      %2 <- x_n + S / x_n
        div      %2,%3        ;      %2 <- (x_n + S / x_n) / 2
        mov      %1,%2        ; x_{n+1} <- %2
        loop     @0,$LABEL    ; dec @0 and loop until @0 equals 0.
        st       $2,%1        ; store result

Note: there is a sqrt instruction.

                MODE_POLL Algorithm:

This algorithm is useful if you want to do more than a couple of
sets of data with the same code.

     load_text(text);
     load_data(data1);
     swap_buffers();
     execute();
     load_data(data2);
     while (!ready())
         cpu_sleep();
     swap_buffers();
     while (true) {
         execute();
         get_data(data1);
         if (finished)
             goto break1;
         load_data(data2);
         while (!ready())
             cpu_sleep();
         swap_buffers();

         execute();
         get_data(data2);
         if (finished)
             goto break2;
         load_data(data1);
         while (!ready())
             cpu_sleep();
         swap_buffers();     
     }
 break1:
     while (!ready())
         cpu_sleep();
     swap_buffers();
     get_data(data2);
     goto end;
 break2:
     while (!ready())
         cpu_sleep();
     swap_buffers();
     get_data(data1);
     goto end;
end: 
     //done!
